Hello
I am Abdul Rahman from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia

I started learning programming when I was fifteen years old

At that time, I did not have a computer, so I started using my father's phone

Which was iPhone 6 the reason I got into programming at that time

And I continue until now is that the computer teacher said that the programmer’s profession is the future and it is fun and brings high income 🙂 I thought that I would become rich if I learned it, so I started in 04/07/2019 following explanations of the Python language most of the day and continued and even learned until I reached the stage I am in now
